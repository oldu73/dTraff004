Check that ConnFile.name attribute is case sensitive which mean the ability to have two (or more) Network treeView entry with same the name
but different case (considered as distinct).

WARNING Side effect is that newly opened ConnFile appear at the end of Network treeView,
even he was (with broken state) on other position in the list.
- Quality check:        NOT OK! at 20170118-1651 on r0.4.001
REM It's working well in current session, but when close and reopen the application, problems appear.
Maybe something to do with preferences.

Update broken state ConnFile.name (path, pref, (etc.)) on contextual menu Open File return if the file chosen
differ from the selected one and is not present in Network treeView.

Test that on first run (user preferences node does not exist yet) createNetwork() process
work's as expected: - only root "Network" entry should appear in Network treeView and mostly
NO NullPointerException due to RootLayoutController.preferences attribute initialisation or first use,
when starting creating new or opening existing ConnFile (file). See also Network class Preferences usage.

ConnFile, Open File contextual menu enabled only on broken state ConnFile object in Network treeView.
The menu status should change from enabled to disabled on ConnFile.state change even if Network treeView selection hasn't changed
(no treeView refresh triggered).
