- Could not load data alert when file is broken (in front of primary stage) at start (-> preferences)

- File (directory) chooser in "Thread" like, UI stay frozen for a while when chooser close on office machine

- File entry in Connections treeView on mouse over show filePath baloon (debrayable preference)

- Create File even if empty

- Change file to Encryt <-> Clear

- Rename file (directly in treeView (no form)?!)

- Raccourci clavier sur les menus (tool bar) et sur les boutons dans les formulaires (tab, tab, tab.. return)

- drag&drop ConnFile in Connections treeView. Where is the treeView objects (ConnFile) persisted?
The opened files order in Connections treeView stay in order they was opened even if in preferences
they are in an alphabetical/numerical order. So, from where comes this order?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> !!!!!! Also, workaround for Functional test number: 004 WARNING -> sort Network treeView alphabetically(numerically)!

- Refactor Connections treeView by Network treeView

- Use ErrorAlert everywhere (find usage of Alert) especially in RootLayoutController where provideAlert
method has been implemented

- Open file on Network contextual menu

- Exception in Alert popup

- Check ErrorAlert for on top of which stage popup is displayed

- Evaluate IntelliJ ability to manage functional testing process (or other dedicated tool)

Seems to be caused by FileChooser which on Office PC may freeze UI on close for a few seconds
and on Home PC display message "Qt: Untested Windows version 10.0 detected!" multiple time (15) in console.
Both PCs run Windows 10-64 OS.
